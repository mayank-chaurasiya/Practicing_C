# C Projects Collection

This folder contains a variety of C programming projects designed to help you practice and understand fundamental programming concepts. Each project is self-contained and demonstrates the use of different features of the C language, such as control structures, functions, arrays, and user interaction.

## Project List

- **GameOfBattleShip.c**  
  A simple Battleship game where the player tries to find and "hit" all ships hidden on a 4x4 grid. The game tracks the number of turns taken to win.

- **Hangman_Game.c**  
  A classic Hangman game. The player guesses letters to reveal a hidden word, with a limited number of incorrect guesses allowed. Includes hints for each word.

- **NumberGuessingGame.c**  
  The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100. The player tries to guess the number, receiving hints to guess higher or lower.

- **random_num_gen.c**  
  A simple program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and allows the user to guess it, similar to the Number Guessing Game.

- **Rock_Paper_Scissors.c**  
  A console-based implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game where the user plays against the computer.

- **Simple_Calculator.c**  
  A basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers entered by the user.

- **SnakeWaterGun.c**  
  A variation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game, where the choices are Snake, Water, and Gun. The user plays against the computer.

## How to Run

1. **Compile the desired project using GCC or any standard C compiler.**  
   Example (for `GameOfBattleShip.c`):
   ```
   gcc -o GameOfBattleShip GameOfBattleShip.c
   ```

2. **Run the compiled executable.**  
   On Windows:
   ```
   GameOfBattleShip.exe
   ```
   On Linux/Mac:
   ```
   ./GameOfBattleShip
   ```

3. **Follow the on-screen instructions for each game or program.**

## Requirements

- A C compiler (such as GCC)
- Basic knowledge of compiling and running C programs from the command line
