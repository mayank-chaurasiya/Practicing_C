# C Language Programs Repository

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of C language programs, practice problems, classroom examples, and topic-wise exercises. It is organized to help students and beginners learn and practice C programming concepts.

## Folder Structure

- **Classroom/**  
  Contains basic to advanced C programs used in classroom teaching. Examples include simple arithmetic, variable usage, file operations, arrays, structures, dynamic memory allocation, and more.

- **Practice sets/**  
  A wide range of practice questions and solutions, covering topics like structures, file handling, loops, arrays, pointers, and more. Each file is named by question number for easy reference.

- **Homework sets/**  
  Homework assignments and solutions, including programs for mathematical operations, conditionals, arrays, and custom problems.

- **practice codes/**  
  Topic-wise folders (Arrays, Basics, DMA, File IO, Functions, Loops, Pointers, Strings, Structures) containing focused code samples and exercises for each concept.

## How to Use

- Browse folders to find code examples and solutions by topic or question.
- Each `.c` file is self-contained and can be compiled using any standard C compiler (e.g., GCC).
- Use these programs for learning, reference, or as a base for your own projects.
